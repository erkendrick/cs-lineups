This project, CS-Lineups, is a web application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It serves as a comprehensive resource for referencing utility usage in Counter-Strike, featuring an infinitely scrollable gallery and a keyword search function for fast lookup of relevant images.

All images in the app are recorded using NVIDIA technology, edited with Clipchamp, converted to GIFs using the free Adobe Express web tool, and are subject to modification or deletion at any time. All images are exclusively created and owned by the proprietor of this repository.
